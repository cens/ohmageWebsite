<h2>ohmage for myself</h2>

<p>
    <span class="provisional">
    I want to learn more about my health behaviors (such as diet, stress, sleep, or exercise), my daily or weekly routines, and the places I visit. I want to be able to easily collect and view this information about myself. I am willing to download an application to my Android smartphone or iPhone, and answer surveys (and receive reminders set at a time that I decide on); if I want, I can collect automated traces of my activity and location that run continously in the background on my Android device, as well as incorporate data from my Fibit(&trade;) or Bodymedia(&trade;) devices. I want my data to stay private, but am willing to share this data with a specific research project.
